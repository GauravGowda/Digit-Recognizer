# DIGIT RECOGNIZER


## PROJECT DESCRIPTION



### Introduction


I recently finished the [Coursera Neural Networks and Deep Learning][1] course from [deeplearning.ai][2]. I am really excited to do this project and apply my knowledge of Vanilla Neural Networks now.

-------

### Methodology


I will be making my Vanilla NN in Python3 using the following libraries      **__(Note, this list is as of November 13th 2019, it may change as the project develops further)__**

* Numpy - To do all the major computations in the program
* Pandas - to load and store the image data
* Matplotlib - to graph different values over time to tune the hyperparameters


-------

### Network Architecture

The neural network will be a L-layer network. This means that I will be testing the best efficiency using different number of layers (having different number of neurons).



-------

### Dataset

I will be using data from a MNIST handwritten digit recognition competition from [Kaggle][3].

### Exploring the training data

Below is an image of different examples of digits given in the training data. Please refer to the above Jupyter notebook to see how I obtained this image.
